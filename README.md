# biotech_AI

The CNN used for this AI is build with Tensorflow and Keras.

### Training

The model is trained in the file `train_model.py` or `train_model.ipynb` if you prefer a jupyter notebook file. When this Python file is executed a file `parameters.keras` is saved to the directory.

### Using the model

The model can then be used with the file `parameters.keras` in the Python file `predict_cell.py`
